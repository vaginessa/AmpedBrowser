Amped Browser
================================================================================================================================
This program is designed to be a quick and simple browser with no bloat while looking beautiful. There will be no features other
than basic web browsing. This allows for a quick no frills browser that anyone can enjoy. I wanted to make a trimmed down browser
that will work on slow connections and provide smooth scrolling and zooming unlike most modern (and heavily bloated) mobile 
browsers. I aimed to do this with a beautiful design. 

Development priority is as follows:
  - Stability/Security
  - Performance
  - Design
  - Features

Known Issues
================================================================================================================================
  - Back button does not go back in WebView
  - No clear text functionality to empty EditText field
  - No settings menu
  - Cannot use Amped Browser as default browser
  - Layout is not perfect
